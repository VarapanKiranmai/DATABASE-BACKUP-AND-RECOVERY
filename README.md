MY FOURTH SQL TASK IS ABOUT DATABASE BACKUP AND RECOVERY ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. THE EVER-INCREASING RELIANCE ON DATABASES TO STORE AND MANAGE VALUABLE INFORMATION MAKES IT ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT DATA IS PROTECTED AGAINST LOSS, CORRUPTION, OR DELETION. THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE PROCESS OF BACKING UP A DATABASE AND RECOVERING IT IN CASE OF FAILURE, PROVIDING A RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTION FOR ENSURING DATA AVAILABILITY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY.
